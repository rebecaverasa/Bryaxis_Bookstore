"Bryaxis" is a fictional creature from the universe of Sarah J Maas's books. This creature out of nightmares resides in the cavernous well of the Night Court library.

<h2>Why this project exists?</h2>
This is a final project from the Coder House React Course. We were able to choose what kind of sales website we would code, so I choose an audiobook sales website due my affinity with this topic.

<h2>What I used to build this project?</h2>
- React<br>
- Vite<br>
- Tailwind<br>
- Nodejs / NPM
